## 📊 Featured Projects

### Project: AI Assistant Receptionist
Designed and implemented an AI-Powered Virtual Receptionist system that handles patient calls, collects key appointment details and automates scheduling by integrating ACS Voice API, Azure OpenAI Realtime and FastAPI WebSocket Services. The system enables natural two-way communication and can connect callers to human staff when necessary.
## Role & Responsibilities:
•	As an AI Engineer, design and deploy an intelligent receptionist system for healthcare clients under SABCVA’s innovation initiative.
•	Conducted daily scrum meetings (morning and evening) to plan tasks, review progress and coordinate development sprints.
•	Integrated ACS Media Stream/Twilio Media Streams with Azure’s Realtime AI model for real-time conversation and audio response.
•	Developed and deployed the FastAPI backend using Azure Web App Services and managed secure credentials with Azure Key Vault.
•	Implemented Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech functions using Azure Cognitive Speech Servies.
•	Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enable context aware responses by integrating dynamic data retrieval into the conversational AI pipeline.
•	Collaborated in data modeling, API testing and Voice flow optimization to improve performance and reliability. 
•	Designed and optimized embedding and vector indexing workflows using Azure AI search to improve information retrieval accuracy and reduce query latency
•	Participated in client presentations and demos to showcase AI capabilities and gather feedback for iterative improvements. Media a REST API using FastAPI and PostgreSQL to store data from learning management systems
## Class of Project:
This project was completed as part of the Applied Learning Practicum course at Union College, combining academic learning with hands-on agile project experience and real-world cloud deployments.

### Project: Dynamic Coffee Store Platform 
Designed, built and deployed a comprehensive solution combining a dynamic e-commerce web front-end (simulating a coffee store) with a scalable AWS data analytics backend. The project leveraged a wide range of AWS Services to demonstrate a full-lifecycle cloud solution, from infrastructure hosting to business intelligence.
## Roles & Responsibilities:
•	Deployed, configured and managed different core AWS Services like S3, EC2, VPN, Lambda, LightSail and Amplify so on to establish a full-stack, end-to-end operational platform.
•	Led the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, using python for data cleaning and transformation of raw JSON datasets to prepare data for scalable querying in the cloud environment.
•	Conducted Scrum meetings to manage agile sprints, coordinate CI/CD efforts using GIT, and ensure alignment between front-end development and back-end data requirements.
•	Defined and implemented core business metrics within QuickSight, developing dynamic visualization dashboards to showcase the solutions business intelligence capabilities.
•	Developed and managed a data lake solution, performing necessary data cleaning and python-based transformation of a large dataset, storing the finalized data securely in Amazon S3.
